	  <h2>About Me</h2>
	  <p> I am currently a Business Analytics Student at <a href="https://wpcarey.asu.edu/">W. P. Carey School of Business</a>, <a href="https://www.asu.edu/">Arizona State University</a>.</p>
	
   
	  <p> As an empiricist, I am passionate in applying and developing data science tools to solve novel challenges in business. Working at Cairn Oil and Gas, India, I utilize Python, SQL, and Tableau to analyze and visualize large datasets, optimize drilling operations, and deliver operational strategies. I have achieved a $3MM cost reduction, a 10% efficiency improvement, and a 2-month project acceleration, among other results. I focused myself to imporve the supply chain of the drill pipe among other drilling inventory. I even managed drilling contracts (including LSTK) and service contracts for third parties.</p>
	  
	  <p> I obtained my Bachelors degree from the <a href="https://petroleum.iitism.ac.in/">Petroleum Engineering Department </a> of <a href="https://www.iitism.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (Indian School of Mines), Dhanbad </a>. Prior to joining ASU as a Business Analytics Grad student, I was working at <a href="https://www.cairnindia.com/Pages/Home.aspx">Cairn Oil and Gas, Vedanta Limited, India</a>. 
	
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <ol>
    <li><b>Airbnb Review Analytics</b>
    <a href="https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bhumit.sheth/viz/DashboardAmesterdamAirbnb/Dashboard1">[Tableau]</a>
		<a href="https://github.com/shethbhumit/airbnb_reviews_analytics">[Code]</a><br>
		<em>Unlocking Airbnb Success Stories.</em> <br>As a passionate enthusiast and key business stakeholder, our primary goal was to understand how Airbnb hosts were performing in Amsterdam. We sought answers to the question: "How much are the top Airbnb owners making in Amsterdam?" This insight provides a glimpse into the lucrative world of short-term rentals.<br>

		<em>Catering to a Niche Market. </em><br> With a long-standing desire to establish an Airbnb Cleaning Business, we embarked on a quest to identify potential customers. By dissecting the data, we aimed to answer the question: "Who comprises the potential customer list for our Airbnb Cleaning Business?" This critical knowledge forms the foundation for our future entrepreneurial endeavors.

		<li><b>Fraud Detection Using Predictive Analysis</b>
			<a href="https://github.com/shethbhumit/Fraud-Detection-Using-Predictive-Analysis">[Code]</a><br> 
			Abstract: A large number of problems in data mining are related to fraud detection. Fraud is a common problem in auto insurance claims, health insurance claims, credit card transactions, financial transaction and so on. The data in this particular case comes from an actual auto insurance company. Each record represents an insurance claim. The last column in the table tells you whether the claim was fraudulent or not.<br>

			<br> Learnings: 
			<ul>
			<li>Dealing with categorical data: OneHotEncoder, getdummies, label-encoder</li>
			<li>HyperParameter Tuning using GridSearch and RandomSearch Methods</li>
			<li>Building a Random Forest Classifier</li>
			<li>Model Evaluation: More focus on False Negatives</li>
			</ul>

		</li>
		<br> 
		<li><b>Predicting Homesite Insurance Quotes</b>
			<a href="https://github.com/shethbhumit/Homesite_Quote_Conversion">[Code]</a><br> 
			This dataset represents the activity of a large number of customers who are interested in buying policies from Homesite. Each QuoteNumber corresponds to a potential customer and the QuoteConversion_Flag indicates whether the customer purchased a policy.<br>
			The provided features are anonymized and provide a rich representation of the prospective customer and policy. They include specific coverage information, sales information, personal information, property information, and geographic information. Your task is to predict QuoteConversion_Flag for each QuoteNumber in the test set.<br>

			<br> Work & Results: 
			<ul>
			<li>Predicted the probability that a customer would buy a quoted insurance plan, using different classification methods in Python.</li>
			<li>Built an ensemble prediction (one-layer-stacking) model, using Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Multi- Layer Perceptron and K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers accomplishing 90% + accuracy</li>
			
			</ul>

		</li>
